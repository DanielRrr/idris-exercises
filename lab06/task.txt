Assignment 6

There are actually four tasks in this assignment:
1) implementing B-device (defined in BDevice.idr);
2) implementing user interface in bdev.idr for operating with one B-device;
3) implementing several type classes instances for B-device;
4) extending user interface in order to support operating with
   several devices.

Try to work in parallel over tasks 1) and 2): your program should run and do something real
as soon as possible. You may treat tasks 3) and 4) as optional unless you feel curious for
blood, sweat and tears all the way.
